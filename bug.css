The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv.container {
  color: purple;
}

#myDiv.container div {
color: yellow;}
```

The issue lies in understanding how CSS specificity works when combining IDs, classes, and element selectors.  While seemingly straightforward, the order of selectors and their combinations can lead to unexpected results.
